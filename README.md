Examples currently included:
 * One case from the J Comput Phys reference (above) for correcting between Lennard-Jones and a sine-modified LJ ("Sine 1")
 * Cases submitted to MSMSE 2018: correction between Morse and exponential-6
     * NVT (canonical ensemble)
     * NPT (isothermal-isobaric ensemble)
