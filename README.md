Try an example through nanoHUB: https://nanohub.org/resources/funuq
The notebooks included in "examples/" can be used to run new simulations, calculate functional derivatives, make corrections, and plot results (without download or install on nanoHUB)

Examples currently included:
 * Correction between Lennard-Jones and sine-modifed LJ for energy and pressure (NVT)
 * Correction between Morse and exponential-6 for energy and pressure (NVT)
 * Correction between Morse and	exponential-6 for energy and volume (NPT)
 * Comparison of bruteforce and perturbative (all-atom or RDF) functional derivatives
